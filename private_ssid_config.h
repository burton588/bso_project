//
// Why this file?
//
// We all need to add our personal SSID/password to each ESP project but we
// do not want that information pushed to Github. This file solves that
// problem. Create an include/private_ssid_config.h file with the following two
// definitions uncommented:
//

#define WIFI_SSID "a1 alpha"
#define WIFI_PASS "druga123"
